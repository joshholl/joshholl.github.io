title: ACID Data Consistency Model
---

ACID is a transactional model typically employed by [Relational Databases](../../../Relational%20Databases.md) and leveraged by [Transactional Workloads](Transactional%20Workloads.md) and [Analytical Workloads](../../../Analytical%20Workloads.md)

ACID Stands for: 
- Atomic
- Consistent
- Isolated
- Durable

ACID is in contrast to [BASE Data Consistency Model](./BASE%20Data%20Consistency%20Model.md)
